# IVI-Ecosystem-Whitepaper

A Framework for a Self-Governing, Self-Expanding, Meaning-Driven Intelligence & Community Ecosystem.

This repository now includes a lightweight Python implementation of **Intangibly Verified Information (IVI)** concepts. The `src/ivi` package provides utility modules demonstrating contextual traceability, usefulness-based verification, belief alignment, social verification, structural redundancy, philosophical heuristics, and decentralized scoring.

These modules are not a full production system but offer a starting point for experimenting with intangible verification methods. See the `src/ivi` directory for details.

## Quick Start

Run the demo script to see the modules in action:

```bash
python3 -m ivi.demo
```
